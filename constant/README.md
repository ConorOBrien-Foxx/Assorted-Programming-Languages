# Constant

Constant is a seemingly regular language. It is infix, like most languages; it has the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. It is different from most languages in that numbers are hardly numbers. They are series of instructions that write to a counter. (There is a different counter for each number.) Further, the only way to increase the counter's number is to increase it by a certain mathematical constant's value. In Constant, there are *cons* which increase the value of the counter and *ops* which modify the program or counter in a different way.
