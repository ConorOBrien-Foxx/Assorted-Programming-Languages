# ORATION
Oration is a breath-oriented, syntax-substitution for python. Your program needs to breathe regularly, else it will suffocate. You can inhale for a large gulp of air, but don't do it too often, or your program wil hyperventilate! Oration is case-insensative, because it doesn't care about your case.

## Commands

 * `(we|i|you) need (.+)$` - `import $1`.
